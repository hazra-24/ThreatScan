Threat Scan: Smarter Protection for Every Message üõ°Ô∏è
This project is an intelligent system designed to detect and filter various cyber threats in real-time, including spam messages, phishing links, and fraudulent voice scams. Using machine learning and deep learning techniques, ThreatScan provides a proactive defense to ensure secure digital communication.



‚ú® Features

Spam Message Detection: Utilizes a Na√Øve Bayes classifier to accurately identify and filter unwanted spam messages.


Phishing URL Analysis: Implements AI-driven, heuristic analysis of URLs to detect malicious phishing links, including zero-day threats.


Fraudulent Voice Scam Detection: A conceptual module designed to use audio analysis and deep learning to identify and block fraudulent calls based on tone and speech patterns.


Adaptive Intelligence: The system is built to continuously learn from new threats and user feedback, ensuring its defense mechanisms evolve over time.

üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

Machine Learning & Data Science: Python, Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy, NLTK


Core Language: Java 


Frontend: HTML , CSS , JavaScript 




Database: SQL 

Development Environment: Jupyter Notebook

üöÄ How to Run the Project
Follow these steps to set up and run the project on your local machine.

1. Prerequisites
Python 3.x installed

Jupyter Notebook installed (pip install notebook)

2. Get the Project Files
Clone the repository or download the files to a local folder on your computer.

3. Set Up the Environment
It is recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies.

Bash

# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv

# Activate it
# On Windows:
venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux:
source venv/bin/activate
4. Install Dependencies
Install all the required Python libraries.

Bash

pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn nltk jupyter
5. Place Datasets
Ensure the following dataset files are in the same root directory as your notebook:

spam.csv

malicious_phish.csv

6. Launch Jupyter Notebook
Run the following command in your terminal:

Bash

jupyter notebook
This will open a new tab in your browser. Navigate to and open the ThreatScan_Project_Notebook.ipynb file to run the code cells interactively.
